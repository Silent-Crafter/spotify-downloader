# spotify downloader
 downloads songs from spotify by searching them on youtube along with adding meta

## Setup

install ffmpeg
if you are on linux
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
<br>
if you are on windows head over to <a href='https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/'>ffmpeg download</a>. scroll down till you find "release". just click on one of the links and extract it. after doing this set the bin folder of ffmpeg to the path.<br>

then run
```
git clone https://https://github.com/Silent-Crafter/spotify-downloader
python3 -m pip install -e spotify-downloader
```

## Usage
run `spotify_downloader [url]` for linux
windows users need to add `.exe` after `spotify-downloader`. i.e. `spotify_downloader.exe [url]`.
input the asked values
for path, specify the path for the directory in this fashion:

``` C:\Music\Spotify```
<br> OR
<br> ``` /home/username/Music ``` (for linux) (DONT USE ~ TO INDICATE HOME DIR)

**NOTE : Do not add a slash at the end of the directory as shown in the example**

you can also use spotify_downloader as a python module by importing it into your scripts. (Docstrings coming soon for help)

### modes
the program will ask you for mode/method.<br>
**ITS FINE IF YOU JUST LEAVE IT BLANK. THE DEFAULT MODE IS 't'** <br>

- __n__ : normal mode/method. searches song normally. <br><br>
- __t__ : topic mode/method. Searches for the music autogenerated by youtube. these don't have a video, only audio that too of the song only. DEFAULT MODE <br><br>
- __a__ : audio mode/method. add (Official Audio) to further enhance the search term for youtube. serves the same purpose as t mode. <br><br>

Recommended is the topic mode. it works for must of the time. but in case if it dosen't use n or a respectively.

## TODO

- [ ] Doctrings
- [ ] parallel downloading
