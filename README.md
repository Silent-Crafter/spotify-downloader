## Setup

## Usage

for path, specify the path for the directory in this fashion:

``` C:\Music\Spotify```
<br> OR
<br> ``` /home/Music ``` (for linux) (i haven't tested it on linux yet)

NOTE : Do not add a slash at the end of the directory as shown in the example

### modes
the program will ask you for mode/method.

n : normal mode. searches song normally. <br>
t : topic mode. adds -Topic in the end. Very usefull to get audio tracks if there is audio from a video or anothe random meme video. <br>
a : audio mode. add (Official Audio) to further enhance the search term for youtube. server the same purpose as t mode. <br>

For playlist the default mode will be 'n'. The program won't ask you.
Recommended is the normal mode. it works for must of the time. but in case if it dosen't use t or a. 

covers are less likely to get fetched for youtube reasons.
