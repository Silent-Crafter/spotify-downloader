Run the setup.py to install missing modules.

## Usage

for path, specify the path for the directory in this fashion:

``` C:\Music\Spotify```
<br> OR
<br> ``` /home/username/Music ``` (for linux) (DONT USE ~ TO INDICATE HOME DIR)

**NOTE : Do not add a slash at the end of the directory as shown in the example**

### modes
the program will ask you for mode/method.<br>
**ITS FINE IF YOU JUST LEAVE IT BLANK. THE DEFAULT MODE IS 't'** <br>

- __n__ : normal mode/method. searches song normally. <br><br>
- __t__ : topic mode/method. Searches for the music autogenerated by youtube. these don't have a video, only audio that too of the song only. DEFAULT MODE <br><br>
- __a__ : audio mode/method. add (Official Audio) to further enhance the search term for youtube. server the same purpose as t mode. <br><br>

Recommended is the topic mode. it works for must of the time. but in case if it dosen't use n or a respectively.
